  abstract = {Researchers are often advised to write balanced scales (containing an equal number of positively and negatively worded items) when measuring psychological attributes. This practice is recommended to control for acquiescence bias (ACQ). However, little advice has been given on what to do with such data if the researcher subsequently wants to evaluate a 1-factor model for the scale. This article compares 3 approaches for dealing with the presence of ACQ bias, which make different assumptions: an ipsatization approach based on the work of Chan and Bentler (CB; 1993), a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach that includes an ACQ factor with equal loadings (Billiet \& McClendon, 2000; Mirowsky \& Ross, 1991), and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) approach with a target rotation (Ferrando, Lorenzo-Seva, \& Chico, 2003). We also examine the {"}do nothing{"} approach which fits the 1-factor model to the data ignoring the presence of ACQ bias. Our main findings are that the CFA method performs best overall and that it is robust to the violation of its assumptions, the EFA and the CB approaches work well when their assumptions are strictly met, and the {"}do nothing{"} approach can be surprisingly robust when the ACQ factor is not very strong.},

  abstract = {Ipsatizing variable prior to component analysis, by subtracting the man score of each individual from all scores of that individual, has met with serious criticisms, both strategic and technical. On the other hand, the procedure is still popular in the study of personality, as a means of removing acquiescence variance. An attempt is made at reconciling these facts. Technical objections to component analysis of ipsatized variables, recently restated by Dunlap and Cornwall, are shown to be based on erroneous premises. A strategic objection leveled by Clemans does apply in a majority of cases, but has no bearing on the specific case of ipsatizing responses to personality questionnaires made up of opposite item pears. As an alternative to ipsatizing by subtraction of the mean, partialling the mean component is suggested as a more elegant procedure, allowing a breakdown of explained variance into variance due to the mean and to subequent components uncorrelated with the mean.},

  abstract = {Data are ipsative if they are subject to a constant-sum constraint for each individual. In the present study, ordinal ipsative data (OID) are defined as the ordinal rankings across a vector of variables. It is assumed that OID are the manifestations of their underlying nonipsative vector y, which are difficult to observe directly. A two-stage estimation procedure is suggested for the analysis of structural equation models with OID. In the first stage, the partition maximum likelihood (PML) method and the generalized least squares (GLS) method are proposed for estimating the means and the covariance matrix of Acy, where Ac is a known contrast matrix. Based on the joint asymptotic distribution of the first stage estimator and an appropriate weight matrix, the generalized least squares method is used to estimate the structural parameters in the second stage. A goodness-of-fit statistic is given for testing the hypothesized covariance structure. Simulation results show that the proposed method works properly when a sufficiently large sample is available.},
